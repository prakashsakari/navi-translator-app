# Na'vi translator app: convert english to navi

## Background about na'vi language
The Na'vi language is the constructed language of the indigenous Na'vi used in the famous Avatar film and games. 
It was created by Paul Frommer, a professor at the Marshall School of Business with a doctorate in linguistics.

The Na'vi have a tribal communal culture. Their history is passed down by oral tradition through stories.

You can learn the language by entering a sentence in English and the translator app will show the Na'vi translated sentence.
